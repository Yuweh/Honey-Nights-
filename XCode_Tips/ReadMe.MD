Tip 1...10
-Tip 001: Shortcut to Object Library: CMD + Shift + L
-Tip 002: The Workspace Toolbar provides access to commonly used commands. The Run button, Stop button, Scheme menu, Activity viewer, Workspace configuration buttons, and Editor configuration buttons.
- The Run button builds and runs your products.
- The Stop button terminates your running code.
- The Scheme menu lets you configure the products you want to build and run.
- The Activity viewer shows the progress of tasks currently executing by displaying status messages, build progress, and other information about your project.
- The Editor configuration buttons let you configure the editor area.
- The Workspace configuration buttons hide or show the optional navigator, debug, and utilities windows.
-Tip 003: Configure the editor area with the editor configuration buttons on the right side of the toolbar. The Standard editor, Assistant editor, and Version editor.
- Standard editor: Fills the editor area with the contents of the selected file.
- Assistant editor: Presents a separate editor pane with content logically related to content in the standard editor pane. You can also change the content.
- Version editor: Shows the differences between the selected file in one pane and another version of that same file in a second pane. This editor works only when your project is under source control.
-Tip 004: The Outline View in the dock shows all the objects in the storyboard scenes nested in hierarchy.
- An essential dock to have open when you are creating your app, as it allows you to understand the structure of your app scene.
-Tip 005: The Navigator Area. Access files, symbols, unit tests, diagnostics, and other facets of your project from the navigator area. Using the Navigator bar, Content area, and Filter bar.
- In the navigator bar, you choose the navigator suited to your task. The content area of each navigator gives you access to relevant portions of your project, and each navigatorâ€™s filter bar allows you to restrict the content that is displayed.
-Tip 006: With the Project Navigator you can add, delete, group, and otherwise manage files in your project, or choose a file to view or edit its contents in the editor area.
-Tip 007:Symbol Navigator. Browse the symbols in your project as a list or hierarchy. Buttons on the left of the filter bar let you limit the shown symbols to a combination of only classes and protocols, only symbols in your project, or only containers.
- What are symbols?
- Symbols are methods and functions within your source code that help with debugging.
- You can specify which symbols are displayed by using the buttons at the bottom of the navigator. Buttons are blue when on and black when off. Use the following buttons in any combination:
- The first button: on the Symbol navigator shows only class symbols and hides global symbol types.
- The middle button: shows only symbols in this project.
- The third button: shows only containers
-Tip 008: Find Navigator. Use search options and filters to quickly find any string within your project.
- Key Shortcut: Command + Shift + F
- This is also a helping hand for debugging.
-Tip 009:ssue Navigator. View issues such as diagnostics, warnings, and errors found when opening, analyzing, and building your project.
- Fourth tool in the Navigator Area that is probably the most useful debugging tool as it shows your problems directly.
- In the right top corner of the editor area there is an issue stepper that you can use to iterate through each error.
-Tip 010:Test Navigator. Create, manage, run, and review unit tests. You will use it to create test targets and run tests on your app.
- The Test Navigator iterates through methods to see if they have the right syntax and make sense.
